  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>This is a work born from a research group of ISKO Italy on the mathematical structure of facet classifications. 
    The link to the web resource is <a href="http://www.iskoi.org/penumbra/">http://www.iskoi.org/penumbra/</a>.
    It is a bibliography developed during the research space, starting from the book of Prolegomena S.R.Ranganathan and developing from works 
    by Charles Sanders Peirce, to first order logic and propositional calculus, up to boundary logic. 
    It ends with Derik Austin's work on PRECIS and John Sowa's work on conceptual graphs.
    In the repository it is possible to find some source code in javascript on the material treated in the bibliography. 
    From a BTree implementation, to a rule Engine, to an advanced conditional probability calculator.
